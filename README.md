# Kubernetes Manifests 

## Summary

A collection of Kubernetes Manifests separated by project for use with deploying to my [personal Kubernetes Cluster](https://github.com/zimmertr/Bootstrap-Kubernetes-with-QEMU).

## Projects

**Personal Website With JS Terminal Emulator**

These manifests are used to build my personal website. They rely on MetalLB to configure a load balancer as well as an exported NFS mountpoint that Kubernetes can bind to with a persistent volume in order to serve up public files.
